Adjust pathing as necessary for your installation.  Requires deepspeech (https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) and deepspeech-server (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepspeech-server (.4.1, .5 seems to have some issues for the moment) to function.  

The included config uses /opt/deepspeech for most things, runs on port 4880 on all interfaces.  Use as a reference mainly.
